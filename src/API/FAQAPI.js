    question: "WHY DID YOU CHOOSE APES ?",
    answer:
      "When we created the Billionaire Club, the team was looking for a realistic way to embody human features. After many discussions, we ended up agreeing on the fact that there was no better and smarter creature than the one pointed by Darwin's theory as being human's ancestor : the ape.",
  },
  {
    question: "GOLDEN GUEST: HOW WILL IT TECHNICALLY WORK OUT FOR THE $500?",
    answer:
      "Technically, before the launch (as soon as we have the IDs of each image), a second smart contract will be set up with a function automating a transfer of $500 (converted into ETH each month) to each OWNER address of a Golden Guest. Very important: This smart contract will snipe on the 16th of each month the owner addresses then execute the transfer. So each Golden Guest will be entitled to $6000 annually",
  },
  {
    question:
      "GOLDEN GUEST: WHAT HAPPENS IF THE ETH LOSES ITS VALUE? HOW DO YOU GUARANTEE IT?",
    answer:
      "The company's funds will not be in ETH but in fiat, so the volatility of the ETH will have no impact on this function of the smart contract. For example, if the ETH goes down to $1000, the transfer amount will be 0,5 eth (you are free to stack them or exchange them in fiat directly). In any case, the funds are guaranteed by smart contract, and the transactions will be done automatically via the company's funds every month at the same date (16th).",
